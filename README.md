*Description*: In FY 2016, the OFLC processed 775,979 employer applications for 1,699,957 positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications. This was a nine percent increase in the overall number of processed applications from the previous year. The process of reviewing every case is becoming a tedious task as the number of applicants is increasing every year.

The increasing number of applicants every year calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in shortlisting the candidates having higher chances of VISA approval. I had to analyze the data provided and, with the help of a classification model:

1. Facilitate the process of visa approvals.
2. Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.
